v0.5.5.4 Changelog:
For tModLoder v0.8.3.4
Updated for v0.8.3.4, pokemon now spawn from pokeballs again. I really wish every tModLoader update didn't break the mod...
Pokemon can now be safely stored in chests thanks to a tModLoader update though, good job @bluemagic123 and @jopojelly
Fixed the PokeNurse texture, she doesn't have a function yet but soon she will be needed to heal Pokemon.
