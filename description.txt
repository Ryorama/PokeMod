v0.6.6 Changelog:
For tModLoder v0.8.3.5
Types and type effectiveness is now in. This should encourage more diverse teams. Currently a Pokemon
only attacks using their first type, and has the weaknesses and resistances of any types they have.
Types, and damage formulae are as per the main series games, with one difference, attacks that don't
affect a Pokemon still deal 1 damage.
Pokemon in the player's inventory are now also healed if the player dies.
